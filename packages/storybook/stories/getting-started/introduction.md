## What is In-App?

_In-App_ is a set of features and components that can be embedded inside
any html page to enhance their functionality. They are _opinionated_,
_configurable_, and _themable_ user interfaces that integrate directly with Courier&apos;s
APIs to help ease the pain of building a complex notification system.

## Why we built these components

We built In-App Components first of all because notifications are _hard_... and integrating third party applications is _hard_ too... If you wanted to build something like this yourself or wanted to build a user interface to integrate with Courier's backend, you'd have to solve a lot of _not fun_ problems like **authentication**, building **proxy api routes** to pass the data off to Courier, and then the maintenance costs of upgrading when Courier offers new features wouldn't be a walk in the park.

We want to offer components that are easy to integrate, work seamlessly with Courier's APIs, and can be styled to match any existing website.

## Features

### 📪 📫 Inbox 📪 📫

While In-App messaging is great, it only works when the recipient of the message is online and paying attention. This is where **Inbox** can help. If we send a message to a user when they are _not logged in_, or if they didn't interact with the message before it disappeared, the Inbox will be able to show the history of messages received.
