## [Client Install](#client-install)

```js
yarn add @trycourier/react-toast
```

## [Courier Integration](#courier-integration)

We will need to install the [Courier Push Provider](https://app.courier.com/integrations/courier) to trigger a toast from an API request.
Make sure to copy the Client Key from the integration page after installing.

Next, create your notification on the Courier Push Designer

Once your notification is created, you also have the option to map an EVENT_ID to a specific notification. This will allow you to use the Courier Designer for test sending.
To do this access the settings pane near the top left corner next to the "Notifications" label. Navigate to "Events" and select an event or create a new one to send the toast on.

## Client Setup

Now that you have a notification ready to be sent lets setup the client to listen for the notification and invoke it when triggered.
