## What is Toast?

Toast aims to be the easiest way to create in-app notifications. With a simple integration and straight forward API we make it easy for anyone to integrate fast.

### What is a `toast`?

A toast is just a buzz word for a notification that happens in-app. The appearance is usually that of a rectangle (which is where the toast name comes from).

### How does @trycourier/react-toast work?

There are two ways to use this library:

1. With Courier as a transport provider
2. A standalone toast interface

You can use the [Courier Push integration](https://app.courier.com/integrations/courier) to create a notification through the designer and send a notification to a specific channel/event from an API request. This will trigger the toast to show wherever the client is running and listening for that same channel/event.

A channel/event combination is simply a stream on which a particular client is listening for toast notifications. A client must be subscribed to a channel and event in order to receive a notification.

If you do not need a push provider such as Courier you can skip ahead to instructions on how to use the standalone toast <a href="#using-hook">interface<a>

Below is a step by step setup to use `@trycourier/react-toast` using Courier as a Push Provider.
